                They often:

                Try to hide the problem by changing their part or hairstyle.<br>
                Buy products that come with claims that they can restore hair.<br>

            <h1>Hair transplant surgery</h1>
            <h3>During a hair transplant procedure, a dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon removes hair from a part of the
                head that has hair and transplants it to a bald spot. Each patch of hair has one to several hairs
                (micrografts and minigrafts). Sometimes a larger strip of skin containing multiple hair groupings is
                taken. This procedure doesn't require hospitalization.</h3>
