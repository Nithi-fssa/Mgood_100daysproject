                    <p>As soon as you conceive, the hormone levels in your body start to change. You produce more of the
                        hormone progesterone.
                        You probably won’t notice any signs that you’re pregnant just yet. </p>

                        period. You may notice your breasts are
                        larger and feel sore, and you may be feeling quite tired.

                    <p>Your baby is growing rapidly, and might be bigger than the placenta now. They weigh about 150g
                        and are about 13cm long - about the length of a nail file.This helps them to gain weight and
                        will define their features. The umbilical cord is becoming thicker and stronger.

                    <p>Your baby is growing and maturing fast. Their muscles have developed and their body is well
                        proportioned, but they are still very thin. They will put on a lot of weight in the next month.
                        Their skin is no longer transparent. It’s red, very wrinkly and is covered in vernix, a waxy
                        coating that protects the skin.</p>

                    <p>Your baby is gaining a lot of weight, ready to be born. They weigh about 1.9kg now. Their lungs
                        are maturing and they are producing surfactant, which means they will be able to breathe by
                        themselves outside the uterus.

                        weighing about 3.5 kg.
                        A well grown, term baby can weigh anything from 2.9kg to 4.2kg – all pregnancies are different.
